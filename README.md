# EmailAttachmentSender

This is a basic program that emails a bunch of attachments in a directory to someone, (e.g, emailing a bunch of eBooks to your kindle).

The time it takes to send the attachments depends on how long it is, it could be a few seconds to 30 seconds to a minute per attachment.

To setup, just launch the application it will prompt you for a username password etc. Afterwards it will automatically use all but your password which is not stored for security concerns.
If you make a mistake you can run `python emailer.py -c` which will remove any stored data to allow you to re-enter it.

(It takes a few seconds to start it up)
