# EmailAttachmentSender

This is a basic program that emails a bunch of attachments in a directory to someone, (e.g, emailing a bunch of eBooks to your kindle).

The time it takes to send the attachments depends on how long it is, it could be a few seconds to 30 seconds to a minute per attachment.

To setup, just edit the code and edit where it says your email, your password, etc

(It takes a few seconds to start it up)
